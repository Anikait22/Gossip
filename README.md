Web Based Modular Chat Application
In today’s fast and technically advanced world, neither do people have the time nor the patience to refer five different applications for five different sorts of work. 
Today all the application makers try their best to include more and more features and functions into their application, but in order to do so they compromise on the simplicity of the application.
This is where we get our idea from. Our application is going to be a web-based forum which will give users the power to perform multiple different kind tasks without even opening a new application. 
Activities starting from gaming to watching movies and videos, from browsing the web to creating calls or chatting with a friend, you name it and we will have it integrated into our forum. 
The main functions of this forum are going to be the power to send/receive messages and make calls. We believe in, “beauty in simplicity” and therefore, the frame work of our forum is going to be supported by an equivalent moto. It'll be so easy to use that even a child could use it.
We believe, “the more features an application has, the better it is but the foremost effective application is the one which has all the features and at the same time is user-friendly.”
